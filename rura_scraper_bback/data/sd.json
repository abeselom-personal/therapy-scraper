    "bio": "Hi! I am currently working with Aspen Counseling Services in Watertown, SD, and online with Rula. I have lived in multiple places across the United States and even Europe (for a very brief moment). So, my childhood and adult experiences are quite unique. I prefer to think that this gives me an enriched perspective that I enjoy bringing into my practice. When I am not spending time with my family, I very much enjoy jumping in on sand or indoor volleyball tournaments, and researching natural health remedies, detox protocols, and tools for my therapy practice.",

The therapeutic techniques I used to get where I am now in life are the same evidence-based techniques I utilize in therapy, so you can have an empowered and fulfilling life. My life has always been about working with and helping people. I began coaching and teaching when I was a teenager and continued this career path until I chose to pursue counseling because it meets my desire to help others. The greatest satisfaction",
